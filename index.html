    <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>

    <h2> Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca 
        citadel, located in the Eastern
        Cordillera of southern Peru, on a 
        2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge
        It is located in the Machupicchu 
        District within Urubamba Province above
        the Sacred Valley, which is 80
         kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco.
         The Urubamba River flows past it,
         cutting through the Cordillera and 
         creating a canyon with a tropical 
         mountain climate.

     <h3> Most archeologists believe that 
        Machu Picchu was constructed as an 
        estate for the Inca emperor 
        Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often 
        mistakenly referred to as the 
        "Lost City of the Incas", it 
        is the most familiar icon of Inca 
        civilization</h3>
