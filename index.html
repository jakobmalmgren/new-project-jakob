           <p class="p1">South America is a continent entirely in the Western 
               Hemisphere and mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with
                a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also
                 be described as the southern subcontinent of the Americas.
                  The reference to South America instead of other regions 
                  (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in 
                  recent decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, 
                  the rise of Brazil)</p>

            South America is bordered on the west by 
            the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east
             by the Atlantic Ocean, North America and the 
             Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. The continent 
             generally includes twelve sovereign states: Argentina
             , Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana,
              Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; two 
              dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South
               Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and one 
               internal territory: French Guiana. In addition,
                the ABC islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ascension
                 Island (dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da
                  Cunha, a British Overseas Territory), Bouvet Island (dependency of Norway), 
                  Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago may also be considered parts of South America.

            South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers
            (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of 2018 has been estimated at
             more than 423 million.[1][2] South America ranks fourth in area
              (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population 
              (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far
               the most populous South American country, with more than half of 
               the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela
                and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the
                 continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power
